## Some words about safety of your Litecoins
* Litecoins in Litecoin Wallet are stored on the device.
* **If you lose your device, you'll lose your Litecoins.**  Just like money in your physical wallet.
* **Before uninstalling Litecoin Wallet** (or clearing app data/wiping your device), **transfer your Litecoins to another wallet**. Any remaining Litecoins will be lost.
* **Transactions cannot be undone!** If you send your Litecoins into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and she is willing to send them back.
* **Keep your mobile device safe!** Do only install apps you fully trust.  Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
* Keep the risk low! **Only use Litecoin Wallet with small amounts** for day use, and keep your Litecoin savings at a safer place.
