			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Litecoin URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the Litecoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Litecoin addresses or Litecoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Litecoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay and the fee you are offering.
			Currently, a minimum fee of LTC 0.01 is recommended in order to get your transaction processed.  With large transactions, even this may not be enough.  Development is currently in progress to compute the correct fee for you when sending coins using this interface.  Look forward to it in new releases!
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a transaction while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Litecoin Wallet.
			If you want a transaction to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN) and have good Litecoin connectivity (see Litecoin connectivity indicator in left notification area).
		</p>
		<p>
			Note:
			Transactions cannot be undone!
			Always check the receiving address.
